# friendlyEmailer

This code emails all the emails of some friends you might have in a text file, separated by new lines. <br />
Sample use case: you have a few hundred friends whom you want to email all the same thing, but you do not want to sit there and tediously copy-paste and enter their addresses again and again and again. <br />
Please do not use this code for nefarious purposes, like spamming people. <br />
Uses the os and ezgmail modules. <br />
Emails through a gmail account that you have. <br />
Please create a separate gmail account if you use this code, so that your main gmail account does not get flagged for spam if it comes to that.
